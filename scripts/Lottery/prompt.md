As a Senior Web3 Solidity Developer, please create a smart contract for a lottery game that meets the following requirements:

- The smart contract must be named "Lottery" and include an owner who deploys it.
- It should allow an unlimited number of players to participate in the lottery.
- Players wishing to enter the game must place a bet greater than 0.01 ETH.
- Only the owner should have the authority to randomly select a winner from the pool of participants.
- After selecting a winner, the game should reset automatically to start a new round.
- Please utilize Solidity compiler version 0.8.11 for accurate compilation.

Please ensure meticulous design of the smart contract, with functions named in an efficient and systematic manner and use correct compiler version.
