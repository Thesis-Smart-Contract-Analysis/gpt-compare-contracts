  "query": "As a Senior Web3 Solidity Developer, please develop a smart contract for Proxy with the following specifications:\n\n- Proxy pattern is a pattern that has two contract (but only generate the first one):\n  - A proxy contract that delegates all calls to the implementation contract.\n  - An implementation contract that contains the logic of the contract.\n- In the constructor of the proxy contract, the implementation contract is set.\n- The implementation can be upgraded through a function in the proxy contract. This function should be restricted to the owner of the proxy contract by using a modifier.\n- The operation that set the implementation contract used in constructor and the upgrade function should be a private function in the proxy contract.\n- Contract has to have a external payable fallback function for delegating the function calls to the implementation contract.\n  - In this function, the contract should use an assembly block to delegate the call to the implementation contract.\n  - The delegation is made by using the `delegatecall` opcode and its return value is checked.\n  - If the call is successful, the return value is returned to the caller. If the call is not successful, the transaction is reverted.\n\nPlease ensure that the smart contract is meticulously designed, with functions named efficiently and systematically, and that the correct compiler version is used. Also, the contract should not have any syntax errors."
