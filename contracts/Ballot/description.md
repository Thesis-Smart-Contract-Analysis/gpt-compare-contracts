- The smart contract should be named "Ballot" and include a chairperson who deploys it.
- Each voter can vote only once for a single proposal from the list of proposals initialized during the contract deployment. The proposal list should contain only proposal names.
- Voters can delegate their vote to another voter. After delegation, the delegator will no longer be able to vote. The delegatee can then vote once for a single proposal on behalf of both themselves and the delegator, effectively casting two votes.
- A voter can only vote with the chairperson's approval.
